        <h3>Plot</h3>    
        <p>
            Since the dawn of mankind, humanity was at peace until the 
            arrival of the Kali Yuga. Since then, greed and hatred have 
            taken over humanity and have been deteriorating it for the 
            past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known 
            as "Suryanshis" chose a man to rise up against all odds and 
            defeat the evil prevailing within the society. He was taught 
            the way to energise the 7 chakras of the body through Kundalini 
            Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. 
            During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death 
            in order to get total control over his powers by entering the 
            holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five 
            natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind, and sky 
            invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a 
            Superhuman. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption 
            and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the 
            world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan 
            by a reporter, Gita Viswas. Later, it is revealed that 
            Shaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the 
            Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.
